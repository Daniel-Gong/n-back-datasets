# n-back-datasets
This is a repo for n-back task datasets.
For n = {1, 2, 3}, respectively, 50 blocks of trials are created, each block containing 30 trials.
The dataset for each block is stored in a `.txt` file. 
- The first line in the file is the letter presented on every trial.
- The second line is the condition corresponding to every letter in the first line ('m':this is a match trial; '-': this is a nonmatch trial).
